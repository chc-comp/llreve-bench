# LLREVE Examples

Files with extension `.smt2` are in SMT-LIB format. Files with
extension `.muz` are in Z3 rules format.

Hi Arie,

there was a recently introduced problem with the smt generation.
I hope I fixed that and can send you now .smt2 and .muz examples from
llreve.

The ones named "faulty_" are not supposed to have a solution.

The others tend to work on one of the engines we tried them on:
eldarica, z3-spacer, z3-pdr or z3-duality.

I will come up with a few examples which would be nice but seem not in
reach at the moment.

Best regards,
   Mattias
